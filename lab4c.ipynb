    "In this lab,  you will learn to write [Structured Query Language (SQL)](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/), which is widely used for retrieve information from database. You will identify the key elements in querying data and understand how relational algebra and SQL can be related to each other. It gives you a sense of how theory can be applied to practice.\n",
